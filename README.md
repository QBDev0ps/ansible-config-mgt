# ansible-config-mgt
Repository for ansible automation and configuration management project.
An additional change perhaps to ensure build artifacts get copied to our new directory.

Web hooks have been configured and it is now expected that changes in this Repository will trigger automatic build jobs in Jenkins.
We hope webhooks will work.
New changes made to ansible to test out new configuration.
